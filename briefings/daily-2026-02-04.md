# Daily Briefing — Wednesday, 2026-02-04

🎯 **TODAY'S FOCUS**
- **Plan v4.0 milestone** — v3.1 shipped Jan 31. Run `/gsd:new-milestone` to define next version scope (mobile app prep? Public launch features?)
- **Apply RLS migrations** — 7 pending migrations (00010-00017) for security hardening. 3 tables still missing RLS: `UserSetupToken`, `CoachCompliance`, `ComplianceRequirement`
- **Enable leaked password protection** — Supabase flagging this as disabled. Quick win: turn on HaveIBeenPwned check in Auth settings

📊 **SERVICE STATUS**
- **Supabase Auth**: All 200s, healthy traffic from radl.solutions
- **Security**: 4 ERROR-level RLS issues, 3 WARNs (permissive policies + password protection)
- **Last activity**: Jan 31 (4 days idle)

⚠️ **SECURITY NOTE**  
`UserSetupToken.token` column exposed without RLS. The pending migrations should address this.

📱 **SOCIAL IDEA**
"When the coxswain says 'light paddle' but you're in seat 4 trying to match the bow pair who interpreted it as 'full send'" — Short video: split screen comparing chill rowers vs one person dying. Caption: "Radl can't fix this, but we can at least tell you what boat you're in."
