      "alternatives": "1) Fix all colors with CSS variables (multi-day effort), 2) Disable light mode with Coming Soon",
      "rationale": "Fixing 1,753 color references mid-sprint is not viable. Disabling with Coming Soon label is honest and unblocks progress. CSS variable migration can be a dedicated sprint later.",
